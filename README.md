# make_tkinter_source

## Description

A script to make a basic class for a simple tkinter app.

## Mac OSX notes

Under Mac OSX, place hardlinks to the make_tkinter_source.py file in ~/bin in
order to launch the script from the command line. The script `make_links.sh`
creates links `mts`, `mktksrc`, and `make_tkinter_source` in the ~/bin.
